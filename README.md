Abstract: Well, I was able to deploy through Mongo_DB. I created a schema incorporating Jane Fonda, Chuck Norris, and Suzanne Sommers. I incorporated their workouts for the week. These included prancercize, bicep curls, zumba, etc. Mr. Norris did a lot of prancercize. Unfortunately, my Mongoose schema would not save due to an invalid JSON. I went off of the animal templates implemented during the previous week. I added express. I did all the things. For my first attempt at deploying to Mongo, I'm pretty darned proud of myself. I have photos from my fantastic schema which I will be incorprating momentarily.
Programs Used: Mac, GoogleFu,Mongoose,Express,Mongo_DB,Github.
